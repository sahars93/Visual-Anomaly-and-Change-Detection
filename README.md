Analysis of  Self-Calibrating Anomaly and Change Detection for Autonomous Inspection Robots

## Introduction

This work proposes a comprehensive deep learning framework for detecting anomalies and changes in a priori unknown environments after a reference dataset is gathered.
We use the SuperPoint and SuperGlue feature extraction and
matching and instance segmentation methods to detect anomalies based on reference images from a similar location.

## Dependencies
You should have a full installation of ROS2 (including Gazebo + Rviz2).
